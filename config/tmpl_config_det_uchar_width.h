 *      Start with 1 and iteratively multiply by two. Since unsigned          *
 *      arithmetic is performed mod 2^N, where N is the number of numerical   *
 *      bits in the type, after N iterations we will obtain zero. Count the   *
 *      the number of iterations needed to determine the width.               *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      1.) C89 requires unsigned arithmetic be performed mod 2^N.            *
 *          Section 6.1.2.5, Paragraph 5 of the C89 draft states:             *
 *                                                                            *
 *              For each of the signed integer types there is a corresponding *
 *              (but different) unsigned integer type (designated with the    *
 *              keyword unsigned) that uses the same amount of storage        *
 *              (including sign information) and has the same alignment       *
 *              requirements. The range of nonnegative values of a signed     *
 *              integer type is a subrange of the corresponding unsigned      *
 *              integer type and the representation of the same value in each *
 *              type is the same. A computation involving unsigned operands   *
 *              can never overflow because a result that cannot be            *
 *              represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced *
 *              modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value  *
 *              that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer     *
 *              type.                                                         *
 *                                                                            *
 *          This can be found in Section 3.1.2.5 paragraph 5 of the standard: *
 *                                                                            *
 *              https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub160.pdf  *
 *                                                                            *
 *          A similar statement is found in 6.2.5 paragraph 9 of the C99 and  *
 *          C11 drafts, as well as 6.2.5 paragraph 11 of the C23 draft.       *
 *                                                                            *
 *      2.) Section 6.2.6.2 paragraph 1 of the C99, C11, and C23 drafts       *
 *          also requires unsigned char to not have any padding. C11 says:    *
 *          Section 6.2.6.2 Paragraph 1:                                      *
 *                                                                            *
 *              For unsigned integer types other than unsigned char, the bits *
 *              of the object representation shall be divided into two        *
 *              groups: value bits and padding bits (there need not be any of *
 *              the latter). If there are N value bits, each bit shall        *
 *              represent a different power of 2 between 1 and 2^(N − 1), so  *
 *              that objects of that type shall be capable of representing    *
 *              values from 0 to 2^N − 1 using a pure binary representation;  *
 *              this shall be known as the value representation. The values   *
 *              of any padding bits are unspecified.                          *
 *                                                                            *
 *          C23 is even more explicit, adding:                                *
 *                                                                            *
 *              Otherwise, there is no requirement to have any padding bits;  *
 *              unsigned char shall not have any padding bits.                *
 *                                                                            *
 *          Because of this, the total number of bits in unsigned char is     *
 *          equal to the total number of bits used for storage.               *
