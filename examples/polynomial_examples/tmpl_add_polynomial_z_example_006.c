 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Provides an example of using polynomial addition in Z[x]. This        *
 *      example shows all of the steps necessary for checking for errors.     *
 *      The only time an error should occur is if malloc, calloc, or realloc  *
 *      fails inside one the called functions. To avoid segmentation faults,  *
 *      it's always best to check for errors. This compiles with GCC, TCC,    *
 *      clang, and PCC, with all pedantic compiler warnings enabled. The      *
 *      result is:                                                            *
 *          (-1 + x^8) + (0) = -1 + x^8                                       *
 *                                                                            *
 *          Trying out tmpl_PolynomialZ_Print_String:                         *
 *          P = -1 + x^8                                                      *
 *          Q = 0                                                             *
 *          P + Q = -1 + x^8                                                  *
 *                                                                            *
