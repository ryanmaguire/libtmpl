 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Provides an example of polynomial multiplication in Z[x] without any  *
 *      error checks. This is the bare minimum needed for a computation. It   *
 *      is best to have error checks, since malloc can fail. The result is:   *
 *          (1 + x) + (1 + x) = 2 + 2x                                        *
