 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      Use the standard Fast2Sum algorithm. Letting "sum" denote the real    *
 *      sum of x and y, and "+" denote floating-point addition, we have:      *
 *                                                                            *
 *          sum(x, y) = (x + y) + err                                         *
 *                    = (x + y) + (y - ycomp)                                 *
 *                    = (x + y) + (y - ((x + y) - x))                         *
 *                                                                            *
 *      This assumes |x| >= |y|. Note that if floating-point addition were    *
 *      associative, the error term would be zero and we'd have               *
 *      sum(x, y) = x + y. Since floating-point arithmetic is not associative *
 *      it is often the case that the error is non-zero. We compute the sum   *
 *      and the error by reversing the above equations. We have:              *
 *                                                                            *
 *          sum   = x + y                                                     *
 *          ycomp = sum - x                                                   *
 *          err   = y - ycomp                                                 *
 *                                                                            *
 *      The values "sum" and "err" are returned.                              *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      Depending on compiler and architecture we may need to declare certain *
 *      variables as volatile. Failure to do so results in a poor Fast2Sum.   *
