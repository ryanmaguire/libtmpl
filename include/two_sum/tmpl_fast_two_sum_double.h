 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      We use the standard 2Sum algorithm. In most cases it is far more      *
 *      beneficial to use the Fast2Sum algorithm, tmpl_Double_Fast_Two_Sum,   *
 *      since this uses only three floating point operations, but this has    *
 *      the caveat of requiring before-hand knowledge that |x| >= |y| is true.*
 *      The standard 2Sum goes as follows. Let "+" denote floating-point      *
 *      addition, and "sum" denote real addition. Let "xerr" and "yerr"       *
 *      denote the error from the x and y terms, respectively, and "xcomp"    *
 *      and "ycomp" denote the compensation factor from x and y, respectively.*
 *      Using this, we have:                                                  *
 *                                                                            *
 *          sum(x, y) = (x + y) + err                                         *
 *                    = (x + y) + (xerr + yerr)                               *
 *                    = (x + y) + ((x - xcomp) + (y - ycomp))                 *
 *                    = (x + y) + ((x - ((x + y) - y)) + (y - ((x + y) - x))) *
 *                                                                            *
 *      If floating-point addition were associative, this error term would    *
 *      simplify to zero, and we would have sum(x, y) = x + y. Since          *
 *      floating-point addition rounds the result, it is not associative, and *
 *      the error term is often non-zero. We compute err by reversing this    *
 *      set of equations. That is:                                            *
 *                                                                            *
 *          sum   = x + y                                                     *
 *          xcomp = sum - y                                                   *
 *          ycomp = sum - x                                                   *
 *          xerr  = x - xcomp                                                 *
 *          yerr  = y - ycomp                                                 *
 *          err   = xerr + yerr                                               *
 *                                                                            *
 *      The values "sum" and "err" are returned.                              *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      Depending on compiler and architecture we may need to declare certain *
 *      variables as volatile. Failure to do so results in a poor 2Sum.       *
