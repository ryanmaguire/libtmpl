 *      Provide functions for dealing with strings. Some of these functions   *
 *      are included in the POSIX standard of the C programming language, but *
 *      are not required by the actual standard. They are provided here for   *
 *      the sake of portability.                                              *

 *      This code is identical to the code I wrote for rss_ringoccs, only the *
 *      rssringoccs titles have been replaced with tmpl. rss_ringoccs is also *
 *      released under GPL3.                                                  *

 *                            A NOTE ON COMMENTS                              *
 ******************************************************************************
 *  It is anticipated that many users of this code will have experience in    *
 *  either Python or IDL, but not C. Many comments are left to explain as     *
 *  much as possible. Vagueness or unclear code should be reported to:        *
 *  https://github.com/ryanmaguire/libtmpl/issues                             *
 ******************************************************************************
 *                            A FRIENDLY WARNING                              *
 ******************************************************************************
 *  This code is compatible with the C89/C90 standard. The setup script that  *
 *  is used to compile this in make.sh uses gcc and has the                   *
 *  -pedantic and -std=c89 flags to check for compliance. If you edit this to *
 *  use C99 features (built-in complex, built-in booleans, C++ style comments *
 *  and etc.), or GCC extensions, you will need to edit the config script.    *

 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Copies a string, verbatim, into a pointer to a char array. This is    *
 *      equivalent to the strdup function, defined in the POSIX standard, but *
 *      not defined in the general standard of the C programming language.    *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *

 *          The string that is to be duplicated.                              *
 *  Output:                                                                   *

 *          A pointer to a char array whose entries correspond to the input   *
 *          string str.                                                       *
 *  NOTES:                                                                    *
 *      A call to malloc is made to allocate memory for the string. You must  *
 *      free the pointer after you are done with it to avoid memory leaks.    *
 *      There is also the (unlikely) chance that malloc failed to allocate    *
 *      memory for the pointer, and returns NULL. You should also check that  *
 *      the output pointer is not NULL before using it.                       *
