 *      Returns the input "x" rounded to its higher order bits.               *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *

 *          The splitting factor. This will most likely by 2^n + 1, where you *
 *          want the higher 53 - n bits to be returned, assuming double has   *
 *          52 bits in the mantissa.                                          *

 *      x_hi (double):                                                        *
 *          The high part of x.                                               *

 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      Assuming IEEE-754 format, we have:                                    *
 *                                                                            *
 *          xhi = (splitter * x) - ((splitter * x) - x)                       *
 *                                                                            *
 *      If (computer) arithmetic were associative, this would cancel yielding *
 *      xhi = x. Since (computer) arithmetic is not associative, this has the *
 *      effect of zeroing out the lower bits of x.                            *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      Depending on compiler and architecture we may need to declare certain *
 *      variables as volatile. Failure to do so results in a poor split.      *
