 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      Returns the input "x" truncated to its higher order bits. The split   *
 *      is done "evenly" down the middle so that x_hi and x_lo both have the  *
 *      same number of bits of x.                                             *

 *      x (float):                                                            *
 *          A real number.                                                    *

 *      x_hi (float):                                                         *
 *          The high part of x.                                               *
 *  Called Functions:                                                         *
 *      None.                                                                 *
 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      Assuming IEEE-754 format, we have:                                    *
 *                                                                            *
 *          xhi = (splitter * x) - ((splitter * x) - x)                       *
 *                                                                            *
 *      where splitter = 2^12 + 1. If (computer) arithmetic were associative, *
 *      this would cancel yielding xhi = x. Since (computer) arithmetic is    *
 *      not associative, this has the effect of zeroing out the lower bits    *
 *      of x. In particular, if float has a 23-bit mantissa, xhi has the      *
 *      upper 11 bits stored in it, correctly rounded.                        *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      Depending on compiler and architecture we may need to declare certain *
 *      variables as volatile. Failure to do so results in a poor split.      *
