 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      For all implementations besides double-double, we have:               *
 *                                                                            *
 *          xhi = (splitter * x) - ((splitter * x) - x)                       *
 *                                                                            *
 *      If (computer) arithmetic were associative, this would cancel yielding *
 *      xhi = x. Since (computer) arithmetic is not associative, this has the *
 *      effect of zeroing out the lower bits of x.                            *
 *                                                                            *
 *      For double-double, we cast to double and return (as a long double).   *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      Depending on compiler and architecture we may need to declare certain *
 *      variables as volatile. Failure to do so results in a poor split.      *
