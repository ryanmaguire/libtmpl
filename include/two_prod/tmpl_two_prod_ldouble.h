 *              Splits an input into two parts, xhi and xlo, so that xhi and  *
 *              xlo have half the number of bits of x. This function returns  *
 *              xhi. xlo is computed via xlo = x - hi.                        *
 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      This is the standard 2Prod algorithm. Split x and y into two parts:   *
 *                                                                            *

 *                                                                            *

 *      xhi*yhi has the highest order bits of the product. Let prod be the    *
 *      product of x and y, with rounding. The error is then:                 *
 *                                                                            *
 *          err = ((xhi*yhi - prod) + xhi*ylo + yhi*xlo) + xlo*ylo            *
 *                                                                            *
 *      We store prod in "out" and err in "err", and return.                  *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      1.) On compilers supporting the "restrict" keyword, out and err are   *
 *          declared as "restrict" pointers. This requires that out and err   *
 *          point to different locations. To properly use this function, the  *
 *          caller should do this regardless.                                 *
