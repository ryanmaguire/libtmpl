 *      We can skip the 2Prod algorithm by the casting to double. An IEEE-754 *
 *      double has a 52-bit mantissa, and a single precision number has 23    *
 *      bits. This means the product of two floats can fit exactly inside a   *
 *      double. We compute the product with error as follows:                 *
 *                                                                            *
 *          prod_exact = (double)x * (double)y                                *
 *          prod_round = (float)prod_exact                                    *
 *          prod_error = prod_exact - prod_round                              *
 *                                                                            *
 *      prod_round is stored in "out" and prod_error is stored in "err".      *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      1.) On compilers supporting the "restrict" keyword, out and err are   *
 *          declared as "restrict" pointers. This requires that out and err   *
 *          point to different locations. To properly use this function, the  *
 *          caller should do this regardless.                                 *
