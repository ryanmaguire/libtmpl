 *      We use the corrected algorithm presented in Li et al. 2002, and       *
 *      follow the implementation in Joldas et al. 2017 near verbatim. That   *
 *      is, we do:                                                            *
 *                                                                            *

 *      The output double-double is out_hi + out_lo. The shorter (and faster) *
 *      Dekker algorithm is:                                                  *
 *                                                                            *
 *          (sum_hi, sum_lo) = 2Sum(xhi, yhi)                                 *
 *                   comp_lo = xlo + ylo                                      *
 *                   comp_hi = sum_lo + comp_lo                               *
 *          (out_hi, out_lo) = Fast2Sum(sum_hi, comp_hi)                      *
 *                                                                            *
 *      Half the number of 2Sum and Fast2Sum calls, but this requires x and   *
 *      y have the same sign. That is, either x and y are both positive, or   *
 *      x and y are both negative. If you are sure this is true, you should   *
 *      use tmpl_LDoubleDouble_Quick_Add instead. The Dekker method also      *
 *      works if |x| is significantly greater than |y|. If you are sure of    *
 *      this, use tmpl_LDoubleDouble_Quick_Add.                               *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *
 *      1.) Depending on compiler and architecture we may need to declare     *
 *          certain variables as volatile. Failure to do so results in a      *
 *          poor Fast2Sum or a poor 2Sum. The source code for 2Sum and        *
 *          Fast2Sum use the TMPL_VOLATILE macro for this. On default builds  *
 *          this macro is empty, meaning the volatile keyword is not used.    *
 *          If unit tests for double-double arithmetic fail, one should first *
 *          try enabling the TMPL_VOLATILE macro. In the Makefile this is     *
 *          done via make USE_VOLATILE=1 [other options].                     *
 *      2.) If both x and y have the same sign, it is faster (and about as    *
 *          accurate) to use tmpl_DoubleDouble_Quick_Add. If x and y have     *
 *          differing signs, you should use this function.                    *
