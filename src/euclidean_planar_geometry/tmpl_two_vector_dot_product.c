 ******************************************************************************
 *  It is anticipated that many users of this code will have experience in    *
 *  either Python or IDL, but not C. Many comments are left to explain as     *
 *  much as possible. Vagueness or unclear code should be reported to:        *

 ******************************************************************************
 *                            A FRIENDLY WARNING                              *
 ******************************************************************************
 *  This code is compatible with the C89/C90 standard. The setup script that  *
 *  is used to compile this in make.sh uses gcc and has the                   *
 *  -pedantic and -std=c89 flags to check for compliance. If you edit this to *
 *  use C99 features (built-in complex, built-in booleans, C++ style comments *
 *  and etc.), or GCC extensions, you will need to edit the config script.    *
