 *      Use the definition of the cross product. If P = (Px, Py, Pz) and      *
 *      Q = (Qx, Qy, Qz), then the cross product PxQ has coordinates:         *
 *          x = PyQz - PzQy                                                   *
 *          y = PzQx - PxQz                                                   *
 *          z = PxQy - PyQx                                                   *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *

 *      The cross product is not commutative, but anti-commutative. That is,  *
 *      PxQ = -QxP. The order of P and Q matters for this function.           *
 *                                                                            *
