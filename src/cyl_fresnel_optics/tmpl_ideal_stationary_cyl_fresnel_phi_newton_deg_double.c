 *      Computes the value phi such that dpsi / dphi = 0. This is the         *
 *      stationary value of the cylindrical Fresnel kernel, and is used in    *
 *      stationary phase approximation for Fresnel inversion / reconstruction.*
 *      The computation is done using Newton's method.                        *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *

 *          The wavenumber, in the reciprocal of the units of rho.            *
 *      rho (double):                                                         *
 *          The "dummy" radius, usually a variable that is integrated over.   *

 *          The azimuthal angle of the point of interest.                     *

 *          The opening angle of the plane. For planetary ring systems this   *
 *          is the ring opening angle of the rings with respect to Earth.     *

 *          The "epsilon" factor, the allowed error in the computation of the *
 *          stationary phase. Once |dpsi / dphi| < eps, the computation will  *
 *          stop and the resulting phi will be returned.                      *

 *          iterations allowed in Newton's method before the algorithm is     *
 *          halted and the current value of phi is returned. For most         *

 *      Use Newton's method. Given the initial guess phi, we compute:         *

 *      "toler" number of iterations.                                         *

 *      1.) Angles must be in degrees.                                        *
 *      2.) Lengths can be in whatever units, but they must be the same units.*
 *      3.) It is assumed B, D, rho, rho0, and phi0 are independent of phi.   *
 *      4.) It is also assumed that the vector from the ring intercept point  *
 *          to the observer is perpendicular to the y axis. This is why this  *
 *          function is called "ideal". For real geometry this may be off.    *
