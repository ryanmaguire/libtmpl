     *  Because of this, we may need to negate the output. We may also need   *
     *  to negate the output if the input x is negative. If the input is      *
     *  positive and 0 <= r < 1, then there is no need to negate the output.  *
     *  If the input is negative and 1 <= r < 2, then there is a double       *
     *  negative which cancels, meaning we do not need to negate the output.  *
     *  Hence, we negate the output if the input is negative XOR 1 <= r < 2,  *
     *  where XOR means "exclusive or." By extracting the leading bit, and    *
     *  performing the exclusive or "^" with the sign, we get the Boolean for *

     *      It is possible for r = 2 to occur (but r > 2 is not possible      *
     *      since we have computed y = |x| mod 2). This will happen if y is   *
     *      very close to 2, such as 1 - 2^-10. In this case, dr is negative  *
     *      and the index for the table will be 0 (see below for both). Since *
     *      sin(pi x) is periodic with period 2, we have:                     *
     *                                                                        *
     *          sin(pi(r + dr)) = sin(pi dr)                                  *
     *                                                                        *
     *      We not need to use sin(pi y) = -sin(pi(y - 1)) in this case, and  *
     *      only negate the output if the input is negative. If r = 2, then   *
     *      the ninth bit of shifted.bits.man3 is 1 and the eigth bit is 0.   *
     *      We do not examine the ninth bit (we've zeroed it out), and hence  *
     *      r = 2 has the same affect as r = 0, as desired. Below we then     *
