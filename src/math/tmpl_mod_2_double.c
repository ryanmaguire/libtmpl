 *          Counts leading zeros in an integer. Used if IEEE-754 support and  *
 *          64-bit integers are available.                                    *

 *          Computes the floor of a double. Only used in the portable method. *
 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      For all methods, reduce the input to non-negative since mod 2 is odd. *

 *      If IEEE-754 support and 64-bit integers are available:                *
 *          The number is represented as 1.xxx * 2^e. By shifting the decimal *
 *          e to the right and zero out all integer terms greater than one we *
 *          have two possibilities: 1.yyy, and 0.yyy. If the result is 1.yyy, *
 *          that's the answer. If the answer is 0.yyy we need to shift the    *
 *          decimal to the right by the number of leading zeros until it is   *
 *          of the form 1.zzz. If this never occurs, the input was an integer *
 *          greater than one, so the result mod 2 is zero.                    *
 *                                                                            *
 *      If IEEE-754 support is available, but 64-bit integers are not:        *
 *          Use bit twiddling to compute the floor of x/2. Use the formula:   *
 *              x mod 2 = x - 2*floor(x/2)                                    *
 *          to complete the computation.                                      *
 *                                                                            *
 *      Portable method:                                                      *
 *          Call tmpl_Double_Floor directly and returns x - 2*floor(x/2).     *
