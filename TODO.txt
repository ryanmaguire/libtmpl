Add polynomial library.
	Have a polynomial be a struct with an unsigned integer pointer
	and an unsigned int. The int is the degree, the pointer is the
	coefficients. Similarly for double and complex pointers.

	Implement root finding algorithm for polynomial from that MIT paper.

	Implement eval function for polynomials.

More functions for complex library:

	complex_sqrt_real
		sqrt of real number, allowing negative real numbers.

	complex_log10
	complex_logb
		complex log in different bases.

	complex_sec/complex_csc/complex_cot.
		Additional complex trig functions.

		Also add inverse trig functions.

	Hyperbolic trig functions for complex arguments.
	Inverse hyperbolic trig functions as well.

	Various powers of small exponent:
		square, cube, fourth power, etc.
