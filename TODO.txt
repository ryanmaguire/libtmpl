Add polynomial library.
	Have a polynomial be a struct with an unsigned integer pointer
	and an unsigned int. The int is the degree, the pointer is the
	coefficients. Similarly for double and complex pointers.

	Implement root finding algorithm for polynomial from that MIT paper.

	Implement eval function for polynomials.
